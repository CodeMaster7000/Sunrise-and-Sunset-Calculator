# Sunrise-and-Sunset-Calculator

June 21st is a significant day in the field of meteorology. It is the Summer Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere, and the Winter Solstice for the Southern Hemisphere. To recognise this, I have programmed a sunrise and sunset calculator coded in Python. Run `python3 Sunrise and Sunset Calculator.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.

NOTE: You must have the `geopy.geocoders` and `suntime` modules installed in order for this program to work.
